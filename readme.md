The "Artificial Intelligence - Bionic" project aims to emulate human cognition through a hybrid AI system. It combines fast thinking using GPT for quick responses and slow thinking via structured reasoning (Think Chain O1) for complex problem-solving. Memory augmentation (RAG) enhances contextual understanding, enabling applications in personal assistants, education, and healthcare.
